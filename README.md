This is a celebration for our 80 subscribers on our youtube channel! Please subscribe, and have fun using my Device-Puller-Pro!


`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Remember to install these in the file directory terminal BEFORE use**

You can do so by installing VS Code (Visual Studio Code) since they have a built in terminal 
you can easily use. If you dont or dont want to install, then get out of here becuase this is for real coders 
and developers who have the skills.

Sorry for my grammer, i am typing fast since i am rushed, but hope you enjoy!

**To start:**

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This is needed to install the libraries we use that you will need to install. Not a big deal, just have python3
installed on your system and you'll be good to go! Just run this command after the requirements.txt has been installed 
and you can use this command:

`sudo python3 main.py`

Remember to use the sudo command as the libraries need admin permissions to scan devices. This can be used for illegal use 
which we do not want, so it can only work when given admin permissions.

when it finishes, it should say "device is reachable", if it says "device unreachable" then its
a fail and the device does not use a OS (windows, macOS, linux, darwin, etc) and therefor cannot pull info
it will give you this if it fully works and the IP is from a real device: 
I did not add the geo info for obvious reasons, but the -- is just an example, though
you will see totally different info that is actually for the given IP, you can see and try some in sample-ip.txt


enter IP: (you will put your IP you want to pull info from here)
(Ip you entered goes here) is reachable.

Device Info:
Hostname: 23.83.224.37.16clouds.com
IP Address: 23.83.224.37
OS Info: Detected OS: Linux 5.0 - 5.14 (Accuracy: 100%)
Port Info: No open ports found.
Local Time: 2025-01-14 17:10:50
GeoIP Info:

I have provided a nice file with 10+ sample IPs i randomly picked! There, you can find some that get pulled from california, mexico, and canada! There is no price to this code, and we make sure we fund it ourselves! But if your interested in our skills, please contact us @ `wolfdream226@gmail.com` and we will respond within 24-48 hours. This is not to be messed with as our system has advanced code. Use for educational purposes only, and not for bad mischeif!
